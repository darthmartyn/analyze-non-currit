    => Also produces verification/gnatsas/report_output/engines-sloc.xsd (XML Scheme).

make standards
    => Runs gnatcheck independently and provides a console output, compiler message style.
    => Useful for the developer to run on their desktop or as a commit hook.

    => Run all analysis engines in Speed mode and output message on the console, compiler message style.
    => Useful for the developer to run on their desktop.

make server
    => A more comprehensive analysis for depth, resulting in various reports being written.
